# Autonomous Driving Car Simulation
You need to make sure the following libraries are installed before running the code
 - numpy
 - OpenCV
 - IPython
 
## Run the Code
Open jupyter notbook using the command suitable with your operating system, then run the code

## Debugging Mode
Set the debugger to true in the debugging function, and stages of the pipeline will appear in the form of images

## Vehicle Detection Testing
Heat mapping is a method used to analyze and detect movemenet of objects in videos, their directional flow and gather clusters of useful data. In our case, it is additionally used to remove false positives during the process of vehicle detection
